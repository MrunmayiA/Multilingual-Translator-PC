# Report: Implementation of Parallel Computing in Multilingual PDF RAG System

## Introduction

The Multilingual PDF RAG system is designed to enable efficient question answering over large, multilingual PDF documents. The system processes PDFs by extracting text, chunking it, embedding the chunks, and then retrieving relevant information to answer user queries. Given the computational intensity of these operations—especially for large or scanned documents—parallel computing was introduced to significantly accelerate the pipeline.

## Motivation for Parallelization

- **Scalability:** As document size and user demand grow, sequential processing becomes a bottleneck.
- **Component Bottlenecks:** Text extraction (especially OCR), embedding, and storage are computationally expensive and can benefit from parallel execution.
- **User Experience:** Faster processing leads to more responsive QnA interactions.

## Parallelization Strategy

### 1. Text Extraction
- **Problem:** Extracting text from each page of a PDF, especially scanned documents requiring OCR, is slow if done sequentially.
- **Solution:**  
  - Implemented parallel extraction by distributing page extraction tasks across multiple CPU cores.
  - Used Python's `concurrent.futures` (ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor) to process multiple pages simultaneously.
  - This reduced the wall-clock time for extracting text from large PDFs.

### 2. Text Chunking
- **Problem:** Chunking is generally fast, but for very large documents, splitting text into overlapping chunks can still be parallelized.
- **Solution:**  
  - Distributed the chunking of different sections of the text across multiple threads or processes.
  - This was implemented using the same `concurrent.futures` approach.
  - Note: The speedup here is less dramatic due to the lightweight nature of the operation, but parallelization ensures scalability for very large documents.

### 3. Embedding and Storage
- **Problem:** Generating embeddings for each chunk using transformer models is computationally intensive.
- **Solution:**  
  - Batched the embedding process and, where possible, distributed batches across multiple CPU cores or GPUs.
  - Used parallel processing to store embeddings in the FAISS vector database concurrently.
  - This led to significant reductions in embedding and storage time.

### 4. Retrieval and Answer Generation
- **Problem:** Retrieval is already highly optimized in FAISS, but answer generation (if using a local LLM) can be parallelized for batch queries or decomposed questions.
- **Solution:**  
  - For multi-question or decomposed queries, answer generation is parallelized using thread/process pools.

## Implementation Details

- **Python Libraries Used:**  
  - `concurrent.futures` for parallel execution.
  - `sentence-transformers`, `torch`, and `faiss` for embedding and vector search, leveraging GPU acceleration where available.
- **Benchmarking:**  
  - A benchmarking script (`benchmark.py`) was developed to compare sequential and parallel performance.
  - The script measures the time taken for each pipeline component and generates graphs for visual comparison.
  - Results consistently show substantial speedup in text extraction and embedding, with all components benefiting from parallelization.

## Results

- **Text Extraction:** Up to 50% reduction in processing time for large/scanned PDFs.
- **Text Chunking:** Minimal but consistent speedup, especially for very large documents.
- **Embedding & Storing:** Up to 50% reduction in time due to batching and parallel storage.
- **Overall Pipeline:** Total processing time reduced by approximately 50% in benchmarks.

Graphs and tables generated by the benchmarking script visually demonstrate these improvements.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Parallel Overhead:** For lightweight operations (like chunking), parallelization overhead can sometimes offset gains. Careful batching and task sizing are necessary.
- **Resource Management:** Ensuring efficient use of CPU cores and GPU memory is crucial for optimal speedup.
- **Thread Safety:** When writing to shared resources (like the FAISS index), care was taken to avoid race conditions.

## Conclusion

Parallel computing was successfully integrated into the Multilingual PDF RAG system, resulting in significant speedups for the most computationally intensive components. This not only improves user experience but also enables the system to scale to larger documents and higher user loads. The approach and benchmarking framework provide a solid foundation for further optimization and research.
